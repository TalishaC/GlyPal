2. Click **"Add Recipe"** button
3. Paste any recipe URL
4. Recipe saves **privately** to your account
5. Edit/modify as needed

### ðŸ‘‘ For Admins: Public Recipe Management
1. See **"Admin"** section in sidebar (admins only)
2. Click **"Manage Recipes"**
3. Import recipes as **public** (all users can see)
4. View/edit/delete any recipe
5. See stats and ownership info

## ðŸš€ Quick Deploy to Replit

```bash
# 1. Commit and push changes
cd ~/Documents/GlyPal
git add .
git commit -m "Add recipe scraping with user/admin interfaces"
git push origin main

# 2. In Replit shell, run migration
npm run db:push

# 3. Make yourself admin (replace 'your-username')
# Option: Use Replit Database shell
UPDATE users SET is_admin = true WHERE username = 'your-username';
